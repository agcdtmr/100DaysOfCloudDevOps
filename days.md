	•	Coding: Create policies that enforce security standards across cloud-native applications using OPA (Open Policy Agent) and implement security checks in CI/CD.

5. Compliance as Code & Auditing
	•	Theory: The importance of compliance in cloud-native environments and “Compliance as Code.”
	•	Hands-On: Use HashiCorp Sentinel, OPA, or Kubernetes Security Contexts to enforce compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
	•	Coding: Automate audits and compliance reporting with code (e.g., create reports on compliance state).

6. Serverless Event-Driven Architectures
	•	Theory: Deep dive into event-driven architectures (EDA) and serverless computing (FaaS).
	•	Hands-On: Build a serverless event-driven application using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions, and link it to services like AWS SQS, SNS, or EventBridge.
	•	Coding: Write a serverless backend for event-driven processing, including triggers and actions.

7. Immutable Infrastructure & Containerization Best Practices
	•	Theory: Immutable infrastructure principles in a cloud-native environment.
	•	Hands-On: Deploy containers that adhere to immutable principles, leveraging Kubernetes and Docker.
	•	Coding: Automate container deployments with Helm charts that enforce immutability in production environments.

8. Kubernetes Operators for Custom Automation
	•	Theory: Learn about Kubernetes Operators, custom controllers, and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).
	•	Hands-On: Build and deploy a simple Kubernetes Operator to automate tasks within your Kubernetes cluster (e.g., managing databases or custom resources).
	•	Coding: Develop a custom Kubernetes Operator using the Operator SDK or Kopf in Python.

9. Multi-Region & Multi-Cloud Failover Strategies
	•	Theory: Best practices for multi-region or multi-cloud deployments for disaster recovery and high availability.
	•	Hands-On: Set up multi-region Kubernetes clusters across AWS, GCP, or Azure.
	•	Coding: Automate failover and backup strategies using Terraform or cloud-native infrastructure-as-code tools.

10. Cloud-Native Machine Learning (MLOps)
	•	Theory: MLOps best practices and the role of DevOps in machine learning.
	•	Hands-On: Deploy ML models in production using Kubernetes and tools like Kubeflow or MLflow.
	•	Coding: Write code to automate the lifecycle of machine learning models, from training to deployment, including integration with CI/CD pipelines.

11. Data Pipelines in the Cloud
	•	Theory: Introduction to building and managing data pipelines in the cloud for real-time analytics and machine learning.
	•	Hands-On: Implement a basic data pipeline using tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, or AWS Glue.
	•	Coding: Create scripts to automate data ingestion, transformation, and movement across cloud environments.

12. Event-Driven CI/CD
	•	Theory: Moving towards event-driven CI/CD pipelines.
	•	Hands-On: Set up event-based triggers for CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, Tekton, or Spinnaker.
	•	Coding: Create custom event-driven workflows for CI/CD pipelines that automatically trigger on code changes or infrastructure updates.

Additional Tools & Technologies to Consider:
	1.	HashiCorp Vault for secrets management.
	2.	Argo Rollouts for progressive delivery.
	3.	DynamoDB, CosmosDB for NoSQL database operations.
	4.	HashiCorp Consul for service discovery and mesh management.
	5.	AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to create Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for cloud deployments.
	6.	Prometheus & Grafana for cloud-native monitoring (in addition to Datadog).
	7.	Kong API Gateway for managing APIs across cloud environments.
	8.	AIOps for cloud monitoring and predictive scaling.

Integrating soft skills, advanced security practices, and multi-cloud strategies will give us an edge, and diving deeper into emerging trends like MLOps and chaos engineering will keep your skill set current and cutting-edge.

Happy learning! You’re on track to becoming a complete Cloud DevOps professional by the end of Day 100!
