üéâ Day 08 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge

In this article, I'll share my understanding of what networking is, how it works, common devices involved, and even did some hands-on tasks to understand it better.

For non-tech professionals, ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù means building relationships, but in technology, networking refers to how devices (computers, phones, IoT devices, and servers) communicate with each other over the internet or within local networks.
