Hi everyone! I'm at the beginning of my tech career.

Join me as I share my journeyâ€”highlighting progress, making errors, be bff with the bugs, read code like it is a novel, linking helpful resources and improvements into writing documentation.

I'm here to ask plenty of questions, question a lot of concepts and encourage a diverse perspective.

Can't wait to learn from you, hear your feedback and engage in discussions with fellow enthusiasts.

Find me here too:
