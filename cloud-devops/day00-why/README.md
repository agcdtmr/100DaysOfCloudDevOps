ðŸŽ‰ Day 00 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge and published it as another tech blog!

In this article, I'll share what the 100 Days of Cloud DevOps challenge is all about and why I'm excited to take it on as a junior in the tech field.

For non-tech professionals, this challenge means that I aimed at enhancing my skills and proficiency in this career trajectory. Making sure to understand how the gadgets, apps, and other modern technology around you works and readily available whenever, however and where ever you might need it.

Hi everyone! I'm at the beginning of my tech career.

Join me as I share my journeyâ€”highlighting progress, making errors, be bff with the bugs, read code like it is a novel, linking helpful resources and improvements into writing documentation.

I'm here to ask plenty of questions, question a lot of concepts and encourage a diverse perspective.

Can't wait to learn from you, hear your feedback and engage in discussions with fellow enthusiasts.

Find me here too:
