ðŸŽ‰ Day 11 of my #100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge

In this challenge, I made sure to document how I was learning a new programming language, Apache Groovy, from basic to just-enough knowledge to start writing Jenkins pipelines.

Hi everyone! I'm at the beginning of my tech career.

Join me as I share my journeyâ€”highlighting progress, making errors, be bff with the bugs, read code like it is a novel, linking helpful resources and improvements into writing documentation.

I'm here to ask plenty of questions, question a lot of concepts and encourage a diverse perspective. Can't wait to learn from you, hear your feedback and engage in discussions with fellow enthusiasts.
