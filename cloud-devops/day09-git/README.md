ðŸŽ‰ Day 09 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge

Someone recently asked me what one of my favourite daily tools is as a Tech Engineer, and without hesitation, my answer was hashtag#Git.

It lets me break things without fear, experiment freely, and collaborate without stepping on toes. Itâ€™s saved me from bad code, overwritten files, and some truly questionable decisions at 5pm on a Friday.

This challenge's focus:
- Git Basics & Essential Commands
- Advanced Git: Workflows, Rebasing, Merging & Conflict Resolution
- Commit Message Best Practices
