# Day 02: Docker Basics: Build a container-based local environment

- [x] Start week 1: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. Reflect and note down on how you learn effectively.
- [x] Write a short article about your understanding of:
- container-based local environment
- Goal of using container-based local environment? and why did I decide to use this?
- What is a local environment?
- What is a container-based local environment?
- [x] Step-by-step guide to configuring a container-based local environment compatible to your machine
- [x] Article conclusion
- [x] Do your [daily tasks](https://github.com/agcdtmr/100DaysOfCloudDevOps/blob/main/README.md#do-the-work-work-work-work)
- [x] Bonus: Architecture Design
- [x] How to [run the Vagrantfile and Dockerfile](https://anj.hashnode.dev/100daysofclouddevops-challenge-day-02-configuring-vagrant-to-use-docker-as-the-provider-for-a-container-based-local-environment)

## How to run

- `cd cloud-devops/day02`
- `vagrant up`
- `vagrant ssh`

ðŸŽ‰ Day 02 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge

In this article, I successfully set up a container-based local environment using Docker with Vagrant. Elaborate why I have to have a separate environment for exploring Linux commands. Explain what a local environment and a container-based environment are, along with introducing Docker and Vagrant. Finally, I provide step-by-step instructions for installing necessary tools, creating Dockerfile, setting up Vagrantfile, starting the virtual machine, and accessing it via SSH.

For non-tech professionals, this task means creating a special kind of setup on my computer that helps me to create a safe and separate space where I can continue to learn and practice without worrying about messing up anything important. Just like having a playground for trying out new things without any risk.
