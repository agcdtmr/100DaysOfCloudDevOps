ðŸŽ‰ Day 06 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCloudDevOps challenge

It took me quite some time to continue on other projects and this one too. (Some of you may know why. Thank you for the support all these months! You all know who you are.)

So in this blog, Iâ€™ll share my understanding of the foundational concepts of Bash scripting and how it can make a huge difference in automating tasks, managing files, and improving overall system efficiency.

ðŸ”‘ Key takeaways:
 â€¢ File permissions, variables, and user input
 â€¢ Automating repetitive tasks with loops and cron jobs
 â€¢ Managing files, processes, and errors effectively

ðŸ’» For non-tech professionals, think about how you could automate routine tasks like organizing and backing up thousands of documents, tracking inventory, or managing schedules. Instead of manually copying files or creating backups one document at a time, a simple script could do all of that for you, saving time and reducing the risk of human error. With just a few lines of code, tasks that once took hours could be done in seconds!
